# Support Vector Machine

**Definition**: Support vector machine is a representation of the training data as points in space 
separated into categories by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped 
into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.  
**Advantages**: Effective in high dimensional spaces and uses a subset of training points in the decision function so it is also memory efficient.  
**Disadvantages**: The algorithm does not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.  

Parameters of SVM:  
* Type of kernel  
* Gamma value  
* C value
