## Practical examples for linear model regression
In this simple example we have 6 persons (3 males and 3 femails) and their score from 0 to 10.  
We want to build a model to see the dependence of score on gender: score ~ gender + $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is an error  

```{r}
# create data frame for the dataset
df = data.frame(gender=c(rep(0,3), rep(1,3)), score=c(10,8,7, 1,3,2))
df

# build linear model
x = lm(score ~ gender, df)
summary(x)
```
