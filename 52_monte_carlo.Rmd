# Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

We have a seq of conditional probabilities:  
We know conditional probabilities for the weather tomorrow (t+1) depending of the weather today (t). R for raily day and S for sunny day.  
$P(S_{t+1} | R_t) = 0.5$  
$P(R_{t+1} | R_t) = 0.5$  
$P(R_{t+1} | S_t) = 0.1$  
$P(S_{t+1} | S_t) = 0.9$  


What is the probability of sunny (S) or rainy (R) day?  
Simulate data using conditional probabilities:  
Markov Chain 1:  
S-S-R-R-S-S-S-S-R-R-R-S-S-S

Markov Chain 2:  
R-S-S-S-S-S-R-S-S-S-S-S-R-R  

After simulation we calculate probabilities of sunny (S) and rainy (R) days:  
P(S) = 0.833
P(R) = 0.167
