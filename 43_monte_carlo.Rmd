# Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

We have a seq of conditional probabilities:  
$P(S_{t+1} | R_t) = 0.5$  
$P(R_{t+1 | R_t) = 0.5$  
$P(R_{t+1 | S_t) = 0.1$  
$P(S_{t+1 | S_t) = 0.9$  


What is the probability of sunny (S) or rainy (R) day?  
Markov Chain 1:
S-S-R-R-S-S-S-S-R-R-R-S-S-S

Markov Chain 2:
R-S-S-S-S-S-R-S-S-S-S-S-R-R

After simulation we calculate:
P(S) = 0.833
P(R) = 0.167
